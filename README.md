# Hyles Polynesia ‚Äì Electric Vehicle Simulation Platform

This project simulates the deployment and performance of electric vehicles in a Polynesian island context. It includes modular tools for configuring different electric fleets, calculating performance metrics, and visualizing outcomes via a Streamlit dashboard.

The simulation focuses on two key subsystems:

- [**Cars**](./code/cars/) ‚Äì Tools and logic for simulating personal electric vehicles.
- [**Bus**](./code/bus/) ‚Äì Modules for evaluating public transport electrification, including route and charging models.

- Streamlit-based GUI for easy interaction and parameter tweaking.
- Separate simulation logic for Cars and Bus systems.
- Support for real-world-like vehicle specs and route profiles.
- Customizable energy consumption, charging strategies, and solar production.
- Visual analytics.
